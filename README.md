# GreVoabInContext

I had a hard time learning vocab for GRE's verbal section. I manually looked up news articles looking for the word that I was studying, in order to learn its meaning in context. While it was a good exercise reading the article, it was time-consuming. Hence I decided to write a program that would scrape well-known news sites like The Hindu/Hindustan Times and extract the paragraph that had the GRE word.
